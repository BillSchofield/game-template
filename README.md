## Advice on how to succeed
* Work in pairs (you don't have to, but it usually let's you get more done)
* Make whatever assumptions you like about how to implement these stories. You can also ask for more details if you like. 
* Do the simplest thing that completes each story
* Only work on one story at a time
* Work on the stories in order
* Make very small changes and run the game after each change
* Commit frequently
* Don't spend a lot of time trying to design your code before you write it
* Do spend time cleaning up and refactoring your code as it grows

* I can fire a missile (that moves straight up) from my ship
* When a missile touches an enemy ship that ship is destroyed
* The enemy ship (Bouncer) starts at the top left corner of screen and bounces between the edges of the screen
* There is a second enemy ship that starts at the top right corner of the screen
* The second enemy ship (Wanderer) moves randomly around the screen (in both the x and y directions), but never moves off the screen
* The Bouncer drops Bombs that move straight down
* The game ends when an enemy projectile hits my ship
* The Wanderer fires Roving Missiles move down and randomly shift left or right

* The new enemy that appears can move like a Bouncer or a Wanderer and fires either Bombs or Roving Missiles 
* Enemy ships can also move in a circle (Circler)
* The game ends when an enemy ship hits my ship
