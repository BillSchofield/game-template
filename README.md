## Advice on how to succeed
* Make whatever assumptions you like about how to implement these stories. You can also ask for more details if you like. 
* Do the simplest thing that completes each story
* Only work on one story at a time
* Work on the stories in order
* Don't spend a lot of time trying to design your code before you write it
* Do spend time cleaning up and refactoring your code as it grows
